## Introduction
A fire alarm sound detector for deaf.
Once Edge ML IC detected alarm, a message will be sent via the Internet connection provided by Surf5.

[![cover-image](/doc/image/cover-image.png)](https://github.com/teamprof/no-os-surf5-alarm4deaf/blob/main/doc/image/cover-image.png)

This project demonstrates how to leverage Surf5, WIZPoE-P1 and Edge machine learning (ML) module to implement an IoT platform with ML capability, powered by Ethernet cable (without AC adapter).

This project is targeted toward deaf individuals who are living in an apartment. It monitors sounds inside a building. If it detects a fire alarm sound, it sends an alert message to the userâ€™s mobile device, signalling them to escape immediately.

WIZPoE-P1 provides 5V power to both Surf5 and Edge ML module. Surf5(W7500) acts as a main controller which provides Ethernet connectivity for sending an alert message to cloud. Edge ML module monitoring sound inside the apartment, it sends Surf5 an alert message if fire alarm sound is detected.

This platform can be expanded to support various applications by upgrading the ML models while keeping the power and controller circuitry.

## LED on Surf5 Board
- User LED: on when an IP is assigned, off otherwise.

## LED on Coral Micro Board
- Edge TPU LED: on when Edge TPU is inferencing, off otherwise
- User LED: on when fire alarm sound is detected, off otherwise
- Status LED: flash when receiving I2C data

## Code explanation
// !!!
### I2C address
The I2C slave address of ESP32 is defined in the macro "I2C_DEV_ADDR" in the file "./src/app/thread/ThreadReporter.cpp"
Here's an example of setting the I2C slave address to "0x55".
```
#define I2C_DEV_ADDR ((uint8_t)0x55)
```

### ThreadReporter
The I2C communication code is implemented in the file "./src/app/thread/ThreadReporter.cpp". "ThreadReporter" is responsible for the following tasks:
1. Pool ESP32 on I2C bus regularly, to check Bluetooth (earphone) connection status on ESP32
2. listens event from "ThreadInference", sends commands to ESP32 via I2C

### ThreadInference
"ThreadInference" (./src/app/thread/ThreadInference.cpp) is responsible for the following tasks:
1. initialize tesnsorflow machine learning code 
2. perform objects detection regularly
3. computes swimmer location and sends event to "ThreadInference"

### QueueMainM7
"QueueMainM7" (./src/app/thread/QueueMainM7.cpp) is responsible for the following tasks:
1. Turn "User LED" on when detected lane
2. Turn "Status LED" on when Bluetooth speaker is connected

### Please refer to source code for details

## Demo
// !!!
Video demo is available on [no-os-surf5-alarm4deaf video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5fEQ51aty8)  


---
### Debug
Enable or disable log be defining/undefining macro on "src/AppLog.h"

Debug is disabled by "#undef DEBUG_LOG_LEVEL"
Enable trace debug by "#define DEBUG_LOG_LEVEL Debug"

Example of AppLog.h
```
// enable debug log by defining the following macro
#define DEBUG_LOG_LEVEL Debug
// disable debug log by comment out the macro DEBUG_LOG_LEVEL 
// #undef DEBUG_LOG_LEVEL
```
---
### Troubleshooting
If you get compilation errors, more often than not, you may need to install a newer version of the coralmicro.

Sometimes, the project will only work if you update the board core to the latest version because I am using newly added functions.
