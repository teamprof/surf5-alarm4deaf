## Introduction
A fire alarm sound detector for deaf.
Once Edge ML IC detected alarm, a message will be sent via the Internet connection provided by Surf5.

This project demonstrates how to leverage Surf5, WIZPoE-P1 and Edge machine learning (ML) module to implement an IoT platform with ML capability, powered by Ethernet cable (without AC adapter).

This project is targeted toward deaf individuals who are living in an apartment. It monitors sounds inside a building. If it detects a fire alarm sound, it sends an alert message to the userâ€™s mobile device, signalling them to escape immediately.

WIZPoE-P1 provides 5V power to both Surf5 and Edge ML module. Surf5(W7500) acts as a main controller which provides Ethernet connectivity for sending an alert message to cloud. Edge ML module monitoring sound inside the apartment, it sends Surf5 an alert message if fire alarm sound is detected.

This platform can be expanded to support various applications by upgrading the ML models while keeping the power and controller circuitry.

### Troubleshooting
If you get compilation errors, more often than not, you may need to install a newer version of the coralmicro.

Sometimes, the project will only work if you update the board core to the latest version because I am using newly added functions.
